# ğŸš€ Simple ORM

## Introduction

```plaintext
Welcome to the SimpleORM Project, an open source PHP ORM designed by me to be used in future 
projects as well as master the behind the scene fundamentals of Object-Relational Mapping, 
advanced PHP OOP concepts, and design patterns. ğŸ“š This project serves as a practical 
playground for me to further understand how ORMs work behind the scenes.
```

```plaintext
This readme serves as the official documentation to this project. All information about how to 
get started using SimpleORM is included in this readme.
```

```plaintext
Why should you use SimpleORM too? because it's blazingly fast. Plus it's open source and easy 
to add new features to it as you wish in order to tailor it to your own needs as a developer.
```

## Simple command line interface

### Introduction

```plaintext
SimpleORM includes a simple command line interface called well... simple. It supports multiple 
commands that make using simpleORM seamless.
```

### Simple commands

- help

```plaintext
This command prints a list of all current commands supported by simple.
```

Example use:

```bash
php simple help
```

- generate

```plaintext
This command generates an entity representing a database table in the Models folder.It is often 
used to efficiently create tables in order to later migrate them to a database later on.
```

Example use:

```bash
php generate:entity Users
```

- migrate

```plaintext
This command migrate an entity from your Models folder to your database.
```

Example use:

```bash
php migrate:entity Users
```

- destroy

```plaintext
This command deletes an entity from the Models folder.
```

Example use:

```bash
php destroy:entity Users
```

- rollback

```plaintext
This command reverses a migration simply dropping which ever table name you give it.
```

Example use:

```bash
php rollback:entity Users
```

## Entities

```plaintext
Entities are simply classes that represent tables
```

### Attributes

```plaintext
Attributes are first set by default when you generate a class and are optional.
You can edit/delete them or make your own.
```

### getPropertyConfig

```plaintext
Every Entity has its own getPropertyConfig method. 
This is SimpleORM gets all the information about how it should create the table in the database.
```

- Important:
```plaintext
If SimpleORM doesn't find the getPropertyConfig method defined inside the entity class it will 
proceed to simply generate the table using the properties instead using default values for each 
column.
```

- supported column types:

- type
- length
- notNull
- autoIncrement
- primary
- unique

Example Use:

```php
 public static function getPropertyConfig(): array {
        return [
            'id' => ['type' => 'int', 'primary' => true, 'autoIncrement' => true, 'notNull' => true],
            'name' => ['type' => 'varchar', 'length' => 255, 'notNull' => false],
            'email' => ['type' => 'varchar', 'length' => 255, 'notNull' => true, 'unique' => true],
            'lastname' => ['type' => 'varchar', 'length' => 23, 'notNull' => false, 'unique' => true],
            'userID' => ['type' => 'int', 'notNull' => false, 'unique' => true],
        ];
    }
```

## Establishing a connection

```plaintext
SimpleORM offers a simple way to establish a connection to your database.
Simply fill up the fields in the .env.db file in the project root with your database 
credentials and you are set.
```

Examle use:

```bash
DRIVER = "mysql"
DB_HOST = "localhost"
DB_PORT = "3301"
DB_NAME = "ormtest"
DB_USER = "root"
DB_PWORD = ""
```

## Entity Mapper:

### Definition

```plaintext
SimpleORM uses an Entity Mapper which is a class that handles entity mapping in 
order to get all of its properties and types that way SimpleORM knows how to create 
the appropriate database table.
Default location: SimpleORM/src/Utils/EntityMapper.php
```

## Entity Generator:

### Definition

```plaintext
SimpleORM uses an Entity Generator which is a class that handles entity generation 
and puts it in the Models folder.
Default location: SimpleORM/src/Utils/EntityGenerator.php
```

## Query Generator:

### Definition

```plaintext
SimpleORM uses a Query Generator which is simply the chef that cooks up all 
of the queries and serves them to the Entity Manager.
Default location: SimpleORM/src/SimpleORM/QueryGenerator.php
```

## Entity Manager:

### Definition

```plaintext
SimpleORM uses an Entity Manager which is the class you will be interacting with 
almost all the time. It's simply the server that takes your order to the kitchen 
then serves you the food. and by order I mean SimpleORM methods/queries and by your 
food I mean data/records from the database.
Default location: SimpleORM/src/SimpleORM/EntityManager.php
```

## How to use SimpleORM

### require Enity Manager Class

```php
require "./src/SimpleORM/EntityManager.php";

use EntityManager\EntityManager;
```

### instantiate a new Entity Manager Object

```plaintext
Required parameters:
- $conn object from SimpleORM/src/Database/connections/conn.php This is autimatically 
included when you require the Entity Manager

```

### Insert Methods

$entity->save();
```

- Batch insert

```plaintext
Required parameters:
- Array of records as associative arrays with column names keys pointing to values
```

Example use:

```php
$entity->saveMany([
    ["name"=> "nam eqwd","email"=> "email@gmail.com", "lastname" => "lastname"],
    ["name"=> "nameqwd2","email"=> "email2@gmail.com", "lastname" => "lastname"],

]);
```
